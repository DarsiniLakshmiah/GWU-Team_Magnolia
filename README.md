Predicting Airline Customer Satisfaction: Identifying Key Factors Influencing Customer Experience

### Proposal:

Customer satisfaction is a cornerstone of success in the airline industry. This project aims to explore and analyze the factors that influence airline customer satisfaction. By identifying key variables, we seek to offer actionable insights to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and improve service quality.

**Objective:** The primary goal of this project is to predict customer satisfaction using various demographic, service quality, and flight-related variables. We aim to uncover trends and insights that can help airlines optimize their services for different customer segments.

**Dataset:** The dataset used in this project has been obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data and contains over 100,000 records of airline passengers. It includes demographic information, flight details, service ratings, and satisfaction outcomes. The data is split into two subsets: training (103,904 records) and testing (25,976 records). We combined two datasets (training and testing files) into a single dataset for a comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction trends.

### Key variables include:

**1. Demographic Information:** Gender, Age, Customer Type (loyal or disloyal).
**2. Flight Details:** Type of Travel (business or personal), Class, Flight Distance, and delay information.
**3. Service Ratings:** Inflight wifi, Food and drink, Seat comfort, Online boarding, and others.
**4. Outcome:** Customer satisfaction (satisfied or neutral/dissatisfied).


### SMART Questions:

1. What are the most influential factors that contribute to customer satisfaction?
2. How do demographic factors, such as age and gender, affect satisfaction levels?
3. How do delays and flight-related factors impact customer satisfaction?

**Methodology:** We will employ various machine learning techniques to analyze and predict customer satisfaction:

**1. Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data where necessary.
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends, correlations, and distributions.
**3. Modeling:** Implement models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods like Random Forest or XGBoost to predict customer satisfaction.
**4. Evaluation:** Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
