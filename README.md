Predicting the reach count for youtube marketing: Identifying key factors impacting the reach on youtube

### Proposal:

Top of the Mind Marketing (TOPM) - 

Marketing is more like understanding the psychology of the user base. TOPM is a widely used strategy across marketing, where brands try to create, build and maintain its image and grow its sales using the impression it created across the market.
Here are few examples:
1. When one has to hire a cab, the phrase "Let's uber!" is more used than "Let's take a cab!"
2. If I say "NIKE", the next thought that follows in one's mind is "Just do it!"
3. "KFC" - "It's finger lickin' good!"
These phrases are most heard of and once heard or seen, are settled in once mind. Hence, the most important factor for marketing is reach of the advertisement. Identifying the brands market and reaching out to the entire market is important to display brand's presence.

Through this project, we aim to find out the effect of different factors on the reach in youtube, so that we can estimate if a brand collaboration with certain channel would meet the reach goals or not.
