Predicting Airline Customer Satisfaction: Identifying Key Factors Influencing Customer Experience

### Proposal:

Customer satisfaction is a cornerstone of success in the airline industry. This project aims to explore and analyze the factors that influence airline customer satisfaction. By identifying key variables, we seek to offer actionable insights to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and improve service quality.

**Objective:** The primary goal of this project is to predict customer satisfaction using various demographic, service quality, and flight-related variables. We aim to uncover trends and insights that can help airlines optimize their services for different customer segments.

**Dataset:** The dataset used in this project has been obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data and contains over 100,000 records of airline passengers. It includes demographic information, flight details, service ratings, and satisfaction outcomes. The data is split into two subsets: training (103,904 records) and testing (25,976 records). However we combined the two datasets in one dataset. 



Through this project, we aim to find out the effect of different factors on the reach of a video on youtube, so that we can estimate if a brand collaboration with certain channel would meet the reach goals or not. The dataset containing reach impact factors like, subscribers count, has_subtitles, age limit restriction, live content, comments enabled, etc. has been obtained from kaggle.

How can we leverage key factors such as subscriber count, view count, like count, subtitles, age restrictions, live content, and comment settings to accurately predict YouTube marketing reach and ensure brand collaborations achieve their intended audience engagement goals from 2005 to 2022?
